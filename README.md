contact details, working hours, and an email form for direct inquiries.

name and email in exchange for wellbeing tips, which can be downloaded via a link sent to
their email.
- **CMS Capabilities**: A user-friendly system that allows Lita to easily update, create, and delete
content across the website, ensuring she can manage the site independently with minimal
technical assistance.
