**Team Code of Conduct Group 5**

**Goals/Philosophy**

- **Core Principles**: We are committed to fostering an inclusive and respectful environment where all members feel valued and can contribute effectively. Our core principles include integrity, collaboration, transparency, and mutual respect.
- **Norms**: We expect all team members to treat each other with respect, listen actively, and provide constructive feedback. Harassment, discrimination, or any form of exclusionary behaviour will not be tolerated.

**How You Will Communicate**

- **Preferred Modes**: Teams for virtual meetings, WhatsApp and Teams Direct Chats for daily coordinations, OneDrive to share files.
- **Project Management Tools**: GitHub.

**Meetings**

- **Schedule**: Meetings will be held weekly on Friday at 9 AM.
- **Agenda Setting**: Agendas will be set by the meeting facilitator and shared at least 24 hours in advance. Team members can suggest agenda items by commenting on the shared document.
- **Meeting Roles**: Each meeting will have a facilitator to guide the discussion, a note-taker to record key points and decisions, and a timekeeper to ensure the meeting stays on schedule.

**Planning**

- **Task Setting**: Tasks will be assigned during weekly meetings and tracked in GitHub Projects. Each task will have a clear owner and deadline.
- **Deadlines and Milestones**: We will set bi-weekly milestones to monitor progress and adjust plans as necessary. Deadlines will be realistic and agreed upon by the team.

**Decision-Making and Conflict Resolution**

- **Decision-Making**: Decisions will be made through consensus whenever possible. If consensus cannot be reached, a majority vote will be taken.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Conflicts will be addressed promptly and respectfully. If a resolution cannot be reached within the team, a neutral third party will be consulted (lecturer or asesor).

**Time-Keeping**

- **Expectations**: Team members are expected to adhere to agreed-upon deadlines and communicate any delays as soon as possible.
- **Monitoring**: Progress will be monitored through regular updates in GitHub Projects and discussed during weekly meetings.

**Review**

- **Reflecting on the CoC**: We will review the Code of Conduct quarterly during a dedicated meeting to ensure it remains relevant and effective.
- **Review Process**: Feedback on the CoC can be provided by any team member at any time. Revisions will be made based on team consensus.
